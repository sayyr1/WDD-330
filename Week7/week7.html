            <h2>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>System errors</h3>
                <p>
                    there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the
                    program is interacting.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Programmer error</h3>
                <p>
                    The program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even
                    be as simple as a typo.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>User error</h3>
                <p>
                    the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to
                    handle.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Exceptions</h2>
            <p>
                An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be
                used by the program to deal with the error.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Warnings</h2>
            <p>
                Warnings A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn’t
                enough to cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue
                to run after a warning. This might sound good, but it can be problematic,
                since the issue that produced the warning may cause the program to
                continue running incorrectly.
            </p>

                <h2>Debugging the Browser</h2>
                <p>When doing this, it can be
                    <strong>useful to create what are known as breakpoints</strong> , which halt the progress of the
                    code and allow us to view the value of different variables at that point in the
                    program.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <h3>The Trusty Alert</h3>
                    <p>The most basic form of debugging is to use the
                        alert()
                        method to show a dialog
                        at certain points in the code.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Using the console</h3>
                    <p>We’ve already seen and used the console.log() method. This can be used to
                        log the value of variables at different stages of the program, although it will
                        not actually stop the execution of the program in the same way as alert()
                        does.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Debugging Tools</h3>
                    <p>One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword.</p>
