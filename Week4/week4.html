        <h2>Notes and Questions: "Ch15: Modern JavaScript"</h2>

        <h3>
            Advantages and Disadvantages of Libraries
        </h3>
        <p>
            Using plain JavaScript can be
            significantly faster than a library5.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Vanilla JS
        </h3>
        <p>
            Additionally, the
            Vanilla JS website showcases plain JavaScript as if it were a library,
        </p>
        <h3>When to Use a Library</h3>
        <p>You have to learn the library’s notation, which can either
            be similar or very different to standard JavaScript. An example of this is jQuery</p>
        <h3>Finding Libraries</h3>
        <p>A library should not be used
            because of a lack of understanding of JavaScript. Instead, it should be used to
            speed up JavaScript development by making it easier to complete common tasks.</p>

        <p>In fact, reading a library’s
            source code is a great way of learning some powerful JavaScript programming
            techniques.</p>
        <h3>MVC Frameworks</h3>
        <p>Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern that’s been used for a long time
            in server-side languages.</p>

        <h3>MV Frameworks</h3>
        <h4>Aurelia</h4>
        <p> is a modern framework that uses ES6, and focuses on letting you
            write dynamic web applications while keeping the implementation details in
            the background.</p>
        <h4> Angular</h4>
        <p> is a powerful framework by Google to make creating dynamic web
            applications easier. This is done by extending the HTML language using
            custom
            ng-
            attributes.</p>
        <h4>Ember13</h4>
        <p> is a framework designed to make building large web applications
            easier. It does this by using common conventions that avoid the need for lots
            of set-up code, though it can become more difficult if you don’t follow these
            conventions.</p>
        <h3>React</h3>
        <p>React21 is developed by Facebook and it has been hugely successful; quickly
            becoming one of the most popular JavaScript libraries that’s used by a large
            number of popular websites such as the BBC, PayPal and Netflix. Vue.</p>
        <p>React uses its own language called JSX. This allows HTML and
            JavaScript to be mixed together in an elegant and concise way</p>
        <h3>nom</h3>
        <p>The Node Package Manager.- npm allows you to install JavaScript packages onto your machine. </p>
